You can choose one or more datasets in the [GeoDA data inventory](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/) or any other data sources for the analyses. The [Hawaii Geospatial Data Portal](http://geoportal.hawaii.gov/) is a good source to obtain local data. You can also use the datasets provided in the previous lab. If you choose to use the lab data, you need to analyze the data in different ways.\n",
