## Course philosophy and goals

Geospatial data are currently generated at an unprecedented speed, providing ample opportunities to study human and environmental dynamics from multiple perspectives at nearly real-time. Geography 389 is designed to introduce computational and quantitative techniques to analyze and model large geospatial data in diverse formats. Specifically, the course will introduce analytical methods to discover and quantify patterns, trend and relationships in geospatial data. It will teach programming skills to automate data processing and analyses with support of geographic information systems (GIS) and other packages. It will also introduce techniques to acquire geospatial data from the Internet. Theories and methods will be introduced in lectures. Workshop style classes will be offered to demonstrate the coding process and usage of tools. Students will have chance to practice the skills using real-world dataset in lab exercise and project. Overall, this course provides an introduction to data science with a geospatial focus. 

The specific learning outcomes are:

*	Be familiar with exploratory spatial data analysis. Be able to visualize, analyze and interpret spatial distribution, patterns and relationships using GIS.
*	Be familiar with statistic and machine learning techniques for spatial analyses, including hypothesis testing of spatial pattern, ‘hot spot’ detection, spatial interaction models, and spatial regression.
*	Acquire coding skills in Python and Python interfaces with ArcGIS and other GIS packages.
*	Understand common methods of spatial interpolation and aggregation. Being able to estimating data in unsampled locations and fusing data in different resolutions and formats for unified analyses in GIS.
*	Learn techniques to acquire geospatial data from the web, including Twitter data streaming, searching, and usages of Google Maps API. Understand basic text mining methods to analyze social media data.

## Prerequisite 
•	Pre-requisite: GEOG 388 or equivalent GIS experience.
•	Basic knowledge of statistics
•	Basic skills of using computers (programming skill is not required)

### Course lab work

Labs will be introduced in class and explanation will be given to accomplish the tasks.  Time will be allotted in class to work on the labs.  If more time is needed, they can be finished after class. **The labs will be due one weeks later after lab is started.  Labs up to 1 week late are penalized 20%. Labs more than 1 week late are penalized 100%**.

Please note you may work together on labs, but you each must do every part of each lab, and **turn in entirely your own work**.  That means each of you should perform every step indicated in the lab manual. **Your grade is for individual effort; copied files/maps from other students will be construed as cheating, at a minimum you’ll get zero credit for the lab, and you may automatically fail the course**.

All labs will be done in computer. We will set up an account for every student in the computer lab. The software to include ArcGIS 10, Python and other analytical packages (e.g. GDAL, PySal, tweepy, and Google maps APIs) for specific applications. 

Students need to submit lab reports for each lab. The lab report should be in **Microsoft Word** or **PDF** file format and submitted to Laulima. Lab instructions will contain numbered questions to be answered and very specific deliverables in terms of maps, tables and graphs.

### Exams
The mid-term and final exam are **closed-book** exam for testing students’ acquisition of core knowledge in the course. The mid-term exam will cover knowledge taught in the first half of the semester before the exam. The final exam will be accumulative, including all course content of the entire semester. 

### Attendance and participation
The standard university guidelines apply, as you might imagine. However, I will repeat some of the essential “rules” for a successful course.  Be respectful to the instructor and fellow students.  Participation in class activities will be noted and will influence your final grade.  The following are never acceptable in class: chronic tardiness, talking out of turn, sleeping, reading non-class material, CELL PHONE USE, emailing or text messaging, and disruptive behavior.  You are responsible to make up missed information or work on your own time if absent or late.  Cheating of any type, on labs or exams will result in a zero for the work and a referral to appropriate school authorities.  This is a “learning through doing” course and you can only succeed through your own personal application.  

**To that end, unexcused absences of 5 or more will result in a failing grade for the course**.  You must communicate with your instructor if you know you will be absent.  Documentation for the absence may be required in order to be “excused.”  

If you have any challenges to learning and need support of any kind, you are invited to contract your instructor or the Kokua Center for assistance or questions.
